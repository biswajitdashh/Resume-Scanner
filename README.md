# Resume-Scanner
Predicts the best candidate fit for the job
## Libraries Used

- `numpy`: A library for mathematical operations in Python.
- `pandas`: A library for data manipulation and analysis.
- `matplotlib`: A plotting library for creating visualizations.
- `sklearn`: A comprehensive machine learning library in Python.
- `re`: A module for working with regular expressions in Python.

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing steps include:

- Train-Test Split: The `train_test_split` function from `sklearn.model_selection` is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.

## Classification Models

Two classification models are used in this project:

- K-nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier: The `KNeighborsClassifier` from `sklearn.neighbors` is used to implement the KNN algorithm.
- Random Forest Classifier: The `RandomForestClassifier` from `sklearn.ensemble` is used to implement the Random Forest algorithm.

## Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the classification models is evaluated using various metrics provided by the `sklearn.metrics` module.

Note: This readme file serves as a general overview of the project and may not include all the details and implementation code. Please refer to the source code files for complete implementation.
